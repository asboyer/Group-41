# Adding Colors in Android Studio

In Android Studio, colors are an essential part of designing an attractive and intuitive user interface. This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding and using colors in your Android Studio project.

## Step 1: Define Colors in `colors.xml`
The `colors.xml` file in Android Studio is where you define the color resources for your project. It's located under the `res/values/` directory.

1. Navigate to the `res/values/` directory in your project.
2. Open the `colors.xml` file. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.
3. Define your colors using the `<color>` tag. Here's an example:

```xml
<resources>
    <!-- Define your colors here -->
    <color name="colorPrimary">#3F51B5</color>
    <color name="colorPrimaryDark">#303F9F</color>
    <color name="colorAccent">#FF4081</color>
    <color name="customColor">#D32F2F</color>
</resources>
``````

Each color has a name attribute that you will use to reference the color in other parts of your project.

## Step 2: Use Colors in Layouts and Code

### In XML Layouts
You can reference the colors you defined in your XML layouts. For example, to set the background color of a button, you can do the following:

```xml
<Button
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:text="Click Me!"
    android:background="@color/customColor" />
``````
