# Adding Colors in Android Studio

In Android Studio, colors are an essential part of designing an attractive and intuitive user interface. This tutorial will guide you through the process of adding and using colors in your Android Studio project.

## Step 1: Define Colors in `colors.xml`
The `colors.xml` file in Android Studio is where you define the color resources for your project. It's located under the `res/values/` directory.

1. Navigate to the `res/values/` directory in your project.
2. Open the `colors.xml` file. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.
3. Define your colors using the `<color>` tag. Here's an example:

```xml
<resources>
    <!-- Define your colors here -->
    <color name="colorPrimary">#3F51B5</color>
    <color name="colorPrimaryDark">#303F9F</color>
    <color name="colorAccent">#FF4081</color>
    <color name="customColor">#D32F2F</color>
</resources>
```
