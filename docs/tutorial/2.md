# Part 2. The Layout Editor

Typically, each screen within an Android app corresponds to one or more fragments. The fragment responsible for creating the screen that displays "Hello first fragment" is named FirstFragment, and it is automatically generated when you create a new project. Each visible fragment in an Android app has a layout that defines its user interface. Android Studio provides a layout editor where you can create and define layouts.

These layouts are defined in XML, and the layout editor allows you to either code XML directly or use an interactive visual editor to define and modify layouts.

Every component in a layout is considered a view. In this task, you'll explore various panels in the layout editor and learn how to alter the properties of views.


## Step 1: Open the layout editor

1. Find and open the layout folder (app > res > layout) on the left side in the Project panel.

2. Double-click fragment_first.xml.

## Step 2: Explore and resize the Component Tree

1. In fragment_first.xml, look at the Component Tree. If it's not showing, switch the mode to Design instead of Split or Code.

## Step 3: Change property values

1. Click on the string in the text property, and you'll notice it refers to a string resource, hello_first_fragment.

'''java
android:text="@string/hello_first_fragment"
'''

2. Right-click on the property and click Go To > Declaration or Usages

3. Change the value of the string property to Hello World!

4. Switch back to fragment_first.xml.

5. Select textview_first in the Component Tree.

6. Look at the Attributes panel on the right, and open the Declared Attributes section if needed.

7. In the text field of the TextView in Attributes, notice it still refers to the string resource @string/hello_first_fragment. You can change the value of string without having to change any other code. 

8. Run the app to see the change you made in strings.xml. Your app now shows "Hello World!".

## Step 4: Change text display properties

1. With textview_first still selected in the Component Tree, in the layout editor, in the list of attributes, under Common Attributes, expand the textAppearance field. (You may need to scroll down to find it.)

2. Change some of the text appearance properties. For example, change the font family, increase the text size, and select bold style. (You might need to scroll the panel to see all the fields.)

3. Change the text color. Click in the textColor field, and enter g.

4. Select @android:color/darker_gray and press Enter.

5. Run your app again and see the changes applied to your Hello World! string
