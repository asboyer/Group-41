# Part 2. The Layout Editor

Typically, each screen within an Android app corresponds to one or more fragments. The fragment responsible for creating the screen that displays "Hello first fragment" is named FirstFragment, and it is automatically generated when you create a new project. Each visible fragment in an Android app has a layout that defines its user interface. Android Studio provides a layout editor where you can create and define layouts.

These layouts are defined in XML, and the layout editor allows you to either code XML directly or use an interactive visual editor to define and modify layouts.

Every component in a layout is considered a view. In this task, you'll explore various panels in the layout editor and learn how to alter the properties of views.


## Step 1: Open the layout editor

1. Find and open the layout folder (app > res > layout) on the left side in the Project panel.

## Step 2: Explore and resize the Component Tree
